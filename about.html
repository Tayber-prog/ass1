        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Hayley Wickenheiser is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, physician, and Olympic gold medalist, widely regarded as one of the 
                greatest female hockey players in history. Born on January 12, 1978, in Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, Hayley began playing hockey at a young age, 
                showing exceptional skill and determination that would lead her to break barriers in the sport.</p>
            <p>Wickenheiser represented Canada in five Olympic Games, earning four medals: gold in 2002, 2006, and 2010, and silver in 1998. She served as a 
                key player and leader on the team, inspiring countless athletes with her on-ice performance and dedication. Beyond the Olympics, she also 
                competed in seven Women's World Championships, winning multiple gold and silver medals, further cementing her legacy in international hockey.</p>
            <p>Her professional career extended across North America and Europe, where she played in various leagues, including becoming the first woman to 
                play full-time in a men's professional league as a skater, rather than as a goalie. This pioneering move demonstrated her skill and opened doors 
                for future generations of female players.</p>
            <p>After retiring from professional hockey, Hayley transitioned to a career in medicine, earning her medical degree in 2015. She has been actively 
                involved in promoting health and fitness, 
                mentoring young athletes, and advocating for the development of women's hockey worldwide. In 2019, she was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame,
                 a testament to her incredible career and impact on the sport.</p>
            <p>Off the ice, Hayley has been a passionate advocate for various charitable causes, including promoting education, healthcare, and physical 
                    activity for youth. Her resilience, talent, and leadership continue to inspire people around the world.</p>
